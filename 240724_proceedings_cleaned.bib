 abstract = {Word frequencies in natural language follow a Zipfian distribution. Artificial language experiments that are meant to simulate language acquisition generally use uniform word frequency distributions, however. In the present study we examine whether a Zipfian frequency distribution influences adult learners' word segmentation performance. Using two experimental paradigms (a forced choice task and an orthographic segmentation task), we show that human statistical learning abilities are robust enough to identify words from exposures with widely varying frequency distributions. Additionally, we report a facilitatory effect of Zipfian distributions on word segmentation performance in the orthographic segmentation task, both in segmenting trained material and in generalization to novel material. Zipfian distributions increase the chances for learners to apply their knowledge in processing a new speech stream.},

 abstract = {How do adults understand children's speech? Children's productions over the course of language development often bear little resemblance to typical adult pronunciations, yet caregivers nonetheless reliably recover meaning from them. Here, we employ a suite of Bayesian models of spoken word recognition to understand how adults overcome the noisiness of child language, showing that communicative success between children and adults relies heavily on adult inferential processes. By evaluating competing models on phonetically-annotated corpora, we show that adults' recovered meanings are best predicted by prior expectations fitted specifically to the child language environment, rather than to typical adult-adult language. After quantifying the contribution of this "child-directed listening" over developmental time, we discuss the consequences for theories of language acquisition, as well as the implications for commonly-used methods for assessing children's linguistic proficiency.},

 abstract = {The English definite and indefinite articles (also known as de-terminers) are a useful index of early morphosyntactic pro-ductivity in children's speech, and give evidence about chil-dren's representation of syntactic abstractions. Previous work (i.e. Pine & Lieven, 1997) used a measure of productivity that shows a strong sensitivity to sample size and does not account for the relationship between adult input and children's learn-ing. In this paper, we develop a more robust metric by em-ploying a hierarchical Bayesian model to characterize the de-gree of generalization implicit in observed determiner usage. By inferring parameters for a generative model over longitudi-nal corpora, we measure the trajectory of grammatical category abstraction. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that child learners exhibit adult-like patterns of generalization quite early in the acquisition of determiners.},

 abstract = {Understanding context-dependent variation in word meanings is a key aspect of human language comprehension supported by the lexicon. Lexicographic resources (e.g., WordNet) capture only some of this context-dependent variation; for example, they often do not encode how closely senses, or discretized word meanings, are related to one another. Our work investigates whether recent advances in NLP, specifically contextualized word embeddings, capture human-like distinctions between English word senses, such as polysemy and homonymy. We collect data from a behavioral, web-based experiment, in which participants provide judgments of the relatedness of multiple WordNet senses of a word in a two-dimensional spatial arrangement task. We find that participants' judgments of the relatedness between senses are correlated with distances between senses in the BERT embedding space. Homonymous senses (e.g., bat as mammal vs. bat as sports equipment) are reliably more distant from one another in the embedding space than polysemous ones (e.g., chicken as animal vs. chicken as meat). Our findings point towards the potential utility of continuous-space representations of sense meanings.},

@inproceedings{Nematzadeh2017,
 abstract = {Vector-space models of semantics represent words as continuously-valued vectors and measure similarity based on the distance or angle between those vectors. Such representa-tions have become increasingly popular due to the recent de-velopment of methods that allow them to be efficiently esti-mated from very large amounts of data. However, the idea of relating similarity to distance in a spatial representation has been criticized by cognitive scientists, as human similar-ity judgments have many properties that are inconsistent with the geometric constraints that a distance metric must obey. We show that two popular vector-space models, Word2Vec and GloVe, are unable to capture certain critical aspects of human word association data as a consequence of these constraints. However, a probabilistic topic model estimated from a rela-tively small curated corpus qualitatively reproduces the asym-metric patterns seen in the human data. We also demonstrate that a simple co-occurrence frequency performs similarly to reduced-dimensionality vector-space models on medium-size corpora, at least for relatively frequent words.},
