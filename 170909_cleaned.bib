 abstract = {Word frequencies in natural language follow a Zipfian distribution. Artificial language experiments that are meant to simulate language acquisition generally use uniform word frequency distributions, however. In the present study we examine whether a Zipfian frequency distribution influences adult learners' word segmentation performance. Using two experimental paradigms (a forced choice task and an orthographic segmentation task), we show that human statistical learning abilities are robust enough to identify words from exposures with widely varying frequency distributions. Additionally, we report a facilitatory effect of Zipfian distributions on word segmentation performance in the orthographic segmentation task, both in segmenting trained material and in generalization to novel material. Zipfian distributions increase the chances for learners to apply their knowledge in processing a new speech stream.},

 abstract = {Word frequencies in natural language follow a highly skewed Zipfian distribution, but the consequences of this distribution for language acquisition are only beginning to be understood. Typically, learning experiments that are meant to simulate language acquisition use uniform word frequency distributions. We examine the effects of Zipfian distributions using two artificial language paradigms-a standard forced-choice task and a new orthographic segmentation task in which participants click on the boundaries between words in contexts. Our data show that learners can identify word forms robustly across widely varying frequency distributions. In addition, although performance in recognizing individual words is predicted best by their frequency, a Zipfian distribution facilitates word segmentation in context: The presence of high-frequency words creates more chances for learners to apply their knowledge in processing new sentences. We find that computational models that implement " chunking" are more effective than " transition finding" models at reproducing this pattern of performance. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {The English definite and indefinite articles (also known as de-terminers) are a useful index of early morphosyntactic pro-ductivity in children's speech, and give evidence about chil-dren's representation of syntactic abstractions. Previous work (i.e. Pine {\&} Lieven, 1997) used a measure of productivity that shows a strong sensitivity to sample size and does not account for the relationship between adult input and children's learn-ing. In this paper, we develop a more robust metric by em-ploying a hierarchical Bayesian model to characterize the de-gree of generalization implicit in observed determiner usage. By inferring parameters for a generative model over longitudi-nal corpora, we measure the trajectory of grammatical category abstraction. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that child learners exhibit adult-like patterns of generalization quite early in the acquisition of determiners.},

@noproceedings{Nematzadeh2017,
 abstract = {Vector-space models of semantics represent words as continuously-valued vectors and measure similarity based on the distance or angle between those vectors. Such representa-tions have become increasingly popular due to the recent de-velopment of methods that allow them to be efficiently esti-mated from very large amounts of data. However, the idea of relating similarity to distance in a spatial representation has been criticized by cognitive scientists, as human similar-ity judgments have many properties that are inconsistent with the geometric constraints that a distance metric must obey. We show that two popular vector-space models, Word2Vec and GloVe, are unable to capture certain critical aspects of human word association data as a consequence of these constraints. However, a probabilistic topic model estimated from a rela-tively small curated corpus qualitatively reproduces the asym-metric patterns seen in the human data. We also demonstrate that a simple co-occurrence frequency performs similarly to reduced-dimensionality vector-space models on medium-size corpora, at least for relatively frequent words.},
