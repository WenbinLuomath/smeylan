# Stephan Meylan

I am a 4th year graduate student and NSF Graduate Research Fellow in the [Computational Cognitive Science Lab]() at the University of California, Berkeley. In my [research](research/) I use computational models, corpus studies, and web-based experiments to investigate how natural language and human cognition shape one another. My advisor is [Dr. Tom Griffiths](http://cocosci.berkeley.edu/tom/). 	

My primary research goals are:

 1. to characterize how the structure of natural language relates to intergenerational transmission, 
 2. to characterize how the structure relates to the the need for efficient online processing, and 
 3. to improve machine representations of the meaning of words. 

I am particularly interested in how people learn the meaning of and process so-called "closed-class" words (articles, pronouns, prepositions, etc.), and the significance of these words in historical processes of language change. See [Publications](/publications) and [Projects](projects/) for more details.
