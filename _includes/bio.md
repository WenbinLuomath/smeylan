I am a computational cognitive scientist who focuses on reverse engineering how children learn language, both to support the development of machine intelligence and to guide educational practice and policies. More specifically, I work on:

1. Understanding how children and adults communicate and coordinate to solve progressively more complex problems
2. Understanding how children's linguistic and non-linguistic knowledge iteratively builds to support the above, and
3. Characterizing how adults process language, as the end state of the above learning problem.

I make heavy use of computational models (neural networks and Bayesian probabilistic models) and my work is distinguished by an emphasis on multi-agent and multi-task learning contexts. I am deeply preoccupied with [Moravec's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravec's_paradox). I also use experimental methods like eyetracking to characterize children's knowledge. See [Publications](/publications) and [Research Topics](/research) for more details.

I'm currently a postdoc at MIT Brain and Cognitive Sciences (in [Dr. Roger Levy](http://www.mit.edu/~rplevy/index.html)'s Computational Psycholinguistics Lab), and hold a joint appointment at Duke University ([Dr. Elika Bergelson child language lab]((http://bergelsonlab.com)), moving Fall 2023 to Harvard).
In 2018, I completed my Ph.D. in the [Computational Cognitive Science Lab](http://cocosci.berkeley.edu) at UC Berkeley (with [Dr. Tom Griffiths](https://psych.princeton.edu/person/tom-griffiths)) on understanding language learning and language processing with probabilistic models. Before that, I was a post-bac research at Stanford (with [Dr. Mike Frank](https://langcog.stanford.edu)). My work has been funded by the NIH, NSF, U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research, DARPA, and the Simons Foundation.

In previous live, I was a data scientist at a crowdsourcing startup and a geospatial data analyst at the U.S. Geological Survey, where I worked on tools for characterizing ocean acidification. I spend my non-academic time on large-format film photography, backpacking and trekking, scuba diving, biking, vegetable gardening, and reading cultural criticism.
