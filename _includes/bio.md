I am a fourth-year graduate student and NSF Graduate Research Fellow in the [Computational Cognitive Science Lab]() at the University of California, Berkeley. In my [research](/projects) I use computational models, corpus studies, and web-based experiments to investigate how natural language and human cognition shape one another. My advisor is [Dr. Tom Griffiths](http://cocosci.berkeley.edu/tom/). 	

My primary research goals are:

 1. to characterize how the structure of natural languages relates to the the need for efficient online processing, and 
 2. to improve machine representations of the meaning of words. 

I am particularly interested in how people learn and use so-called "closed-class" words (articles, pronouns, prepositions, etc.), and the significance of these words in historical processes of language change. See [Publications](/publications) and [Projects](/projects) for more details.
