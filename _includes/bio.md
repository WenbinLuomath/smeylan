I am a computational cognitive scientist who focuses on reverse engineering how children learn language, both to support the development of machine intelligence and to better understand early developmental processes. More specifically, I work on understanding how children and adults communicate and coordinate to solve progressively more complex problems using language.

I make heavy use of computational models (neural networks and Bayesian probabilistic models) and my work is distinguished by an emphasis on multi-agent and multi-task learning contexts. I am deeply preoccupied with [Moravec's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravec's_paradox). I also use experimental methods like eyetracking to characterize children's knowledge. See [Publications](/publications) and [Research Topics](/research) for more details.

I'm currently a research scientist in the Department of Linguistics at UC Berkeley, working on animal and human models of communication with [Gasper Begus](https://www.gasperbegus.com). Previous to that, I was a research sscientist at the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT (in [Dr. Roger Levy](http://www.mit.edu/~rplevy/index.html)'s Computational Psycholinguistics Lab). I have previously worked with the Bergelson Lab (Dr. Elika Bergelson, at Duke and now Harvard). I completed a Ph.D. in the [Computational Cognitive Science Lab](http://cocosci.berkeley.edu) at UC Berkeley (with [Dr. Tom Griffiths](https://psych.princeton.edu/person/tom-griffiths)). My work has been funded by the NIH, NSF, U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research, DARPA, and the Simons Foundation.

Before focusing on human cognition, I was a data scientist at a crowdsourcing startup and a geospatial data analyst at the U.S. Geological Survey, where I worked on tools for characterizing ocean acidification. I spend my non-academic time on large-format film photography, backpacking and trekking, scuba diving, and vegetable gardening.
