I am a fifth-year graduate student and NSF Graduate Research Fellow in the [Computational Cognitive Science Lab](http://cocosci.berkeley.edu) at the University of California, Berkeley. In my [research](/projects) I use computational models, corpus studies, and web-based experiments to investigate how natural language and human cognition shape one another. My advisor is [Dr. Tom Griffiths](http://cocosci.berkeley.edu/tom/). 	

My primary research goals are:

 1. to characterize how the structure of natural languages is shaped by the need for efficient online processing
 2. to characterize the origins of generative linguistic knowledge in early development
 3. to improve machine representations of the meaning of words and word senses. 

I am particularly interested in how people learn and use so-called "closed-class" words (articles, pronouns, prepositions, etc.), and the significance of these words in historical processes of language change. See [Publications](/publications) and [Projects](/projects) for more details.
